Extract EAD from custom MS Access database

The EAD-db-convert program is a Java-based tool written specifically to extract data from a Microsoft Access database and to use that data to create EAD-compliant XML files. The code could be modified to work with different Microsoft Access databases, however, there is much University of Maryland-specific information currently hard-coded into the JAVA. 

The program allows for the conversion of a single finding aid or of a batch.

It was created by Amit Kumar in 2004, with input and requirements by Jennie Levine (Knies).  Modifications have been made over the years by Jennie Levine Knies, Ben Wallberg, and David Kennedy.
